## UX

## General

Broder is an e-commerce website built using Python and Django. 
The site is fully responsive on all modern screen sizes, and it allows a user to add and remove products
to a basket and buy them using stripe as payment method. This is for education purposes so the credit card is
not linked to a bank account, you can use 4242 4242 42424 4242 and any cvc to test and you will receive an email
with the "fake" purchase details.
The live site can be viewed [here](https://ms4-broder.herokuapp.com/).

### User Stories

As a first time user, I want:
- To quickly be able to understand the purpose of the website.
- To be able to register, sign in and sign out with ease.
- To navigate through the site and easily find the products I want.

As a returning visitor, I want:
- To sign in as easily as I did on my first visit and remain signed in if I 
choose to.
- To be able to reset my password.
- To be able to view all my purchases from my profile.
- To be able to save my details for future purchases.

As a frequent user, I want:
- To sign in and view my purchases.
- To add products to my basket and that they remain there for future purchase.
- To change some of my user details.

### User Journey

1. User's Journey starts at the homepage. 
1. They are presented with a picture hat hints at what the site it’s about.
1. On the bottom they can see and “About” description

### Design

- Colour Scheme
    - I used a friendly light emerald color scheme with a transparent option in some elements. Originally it was white but it felt a little traditional.
- Typography
    - I used 'Sarabun' as a font 
- Imagery
    - Most of the images were downloaded from pinterest with the idea of background ion white or similar 

### Features

- The navigation menu will offer users a number of site locations depending on their user access. 
- Pay for products using Stripe.
- View products from the user personal account.
- Allauth user accounts.
- CRUD Functionality.

## Database Design

This database uses a SQL database through PostgreSQL. They were originally built in JSON files.

### Categories Database

## Navigation

The navbar at the top of the page has search element in the middle, a logo on the left side
and on the right side a user icon and a basket icon that shows the amount to spend for the selceted products. 
The User Icon will display a profile option if the user is logged in if not, it will show a "login" or "register" option
In the body of the page there is an image that suggest what the website is about, and the title or "brand" of the website
is "Broder" which means embroidery in french.
The footer shows a little about me description on teh right and a short text on the left of what the site provides.
The footer is only visible in the index page, this was made on purpose to make the website more user friendly for purchases.

## Features Left to Implement

I would have liked to have a logo, I didn’t have time to design it.
On one of the tabs I will like to add some pictures of the artist doing works from start to finish.

Deployment
----------

To deploy this project you will need to set up accounts with the following services.

- [Github](https://github.com/)     
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)   
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)   
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)   
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)    


### Deployment to Heroku  

1. **Create a Heroku App**
    1. Create a new app by clicking the ‘New’ button.
    ![new Heroku app button](static/media/new-app.png)
    2. Give a unique name and set region to your nearest region.
    ![name and region input](static/media/name-region.png)
    3. Click ‘Create App’.
    4. Click on the 'Resources' tab, in Add-ons type: postgress and choose 'Heroku Postgres'.
    ![postgres add-on](static/media/postgress.png)  
    5. For plan name choose the free plan and click submit form.

2. **Setup the Postgres Database**
    1. In your IDE install dj_database_url and psycopg2.   
        ```
        pip3 install dj_database_url
        pip3 install psycopg2-binary
        ```
    2. Create a requirements file.  
        ```
        pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
        ```
    3. Import dj_database_url in `settings.py`.
    4. Backup the database if you're using a local database instead of fixtures.  
        ```
        python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
        ```  
        p.s. make sure you're connected to your mysql database.  
    5. Scroll down to DATABASES, comment out the default configuration and add the database url from Heroku   
        ```
        DATABASES = {
                'default': dj_database_url.parse('DATABASE_URL')
        }
        ```
        You can the database url from Heroku's Config Vars in the Settings tab. 
        > Note: The DATABASE_URL from Heroku is an environment variable and shouldn't be committed in version control.
    6. Run migrations.  
          ```
          python3 manage.py migrate
          ```
    7. In case of using a local database type:  
        ```
        python3 manage.py loaddata db.json
        ```  
        to import the data from the mySQL database to Postgre.
    8. In case of using fixtures:  
        First import the categories:  
        ```
        python3 manage.py loaddata categories
        ```  
        And then the products:  
        ```
        python3 manage.py loaddata products
        ```  
    
3. **Create a superuser**  
    - Type: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`  
    - Add a username and password.

4. **Make a distinction between local and remote database**  
    Create an if-statement in `settings.py` so that when the app is running on Heroku it connects to Postgres(remote) and otherwise, it connects to sequel light(local).  
    ```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
            }
        }
    ```
5. **Install gunicorn**  
    Gunicorn will replace the development server once the app is deployed to Heroku and will act as the web server.  
    type: `pip3 install gunicorn`

6. **Create a Heroku 'Procfile'**  
    The Procfile is what Heroku looks for to know which file runs the app and how to run it.
    1. In the terminal type: **touch Procfile** or create a new file named 'Procfile' in the root.
    2. Inside the Procfile type:   
    ```
    web: gunicorn <Github appname>.wsgi:application
    ```

7. **Connect to Heroku in the terminal**
    1. Login to your account on the Heroku website.
    2. Go to account settings (click on your avatar).
    3. Scroll down to the API Key section.
    4. Click 'Reveal' and copy your API Key.
    5. Login to Heroku via CLI  
     ```
     heroku login -i
     ```
    6. Login with your email but use the API Key as the password.
    7. Temporarily disable the collection of static files until AWS has been setup.  
        ```
        heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <Heroku appname>
        ```  
    8. Add the hostnames to allowed hosts in `settings.py`.  
        ```
        ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<heroku appname>.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']
        ```
       where 127.0.0.1 is the IP of the localhost, so that the app can also run locally.
    9. Commit to GitHub.
    10. Commit to Heroku. Make sure you have git remote initialized.  
        ```
        heroku git:remote -a <Heroku appname>
        ```  
        Push to Heroku.  
        ```
        git push heroku
        ```

8. **Setup automatic deployment from GitHub/Connect Heroku app to GitHub.**  
    1. Go to the Deploy tab.  
    ![deploy tab](static/media/deploy.png)  
    2. Under 'Deployment method', Click on 'Connect to GitHub'.

### Setup local deployment

1. **Clone or fork this repository (see above)**.
2. **Install the requirements by typing:**  
        ```
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        ```  
   in the terminal.
3. **Set the environment variables.**
    1. If you're using GitPod.

**Bugs**

+ **Bug-01:** checkout migrations error -  It was working because the migration file was trying to remove a field named sku from one of the previous migrations, I had to delete those lines and run the migrations again,  I had to backup my database in case the migration failed with the dumpdata command.

+ **Bug-02:** Checkout_order error - I forgot to run migrations for the order model.

+ **Bug-03:** Change category error - I updated one category from the admin panel but the link on the navbar will not redirect,this was because the URL was not updated with the same name as the category, it had the old name.
