## UX

## General

Broder is an e-commerce website built using Python and Django. 
The target audience of the site is anybody interested in Art and fashion as the artist of the site works on clothes
and also works of art.
The site is fully responsive on all modern screen sizes, and it allows a user to add and remove products
to a basket and buy them using stripe as payment method. This is for education purposes so for testing the 
checkout please use the following card number and details:

Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Month/Year : 04 / 24
CVC: 222
ZIP: 44444
The live site can be viewed [here](https://ms4-broder.herokuapp.com/).

## Database Design

The final data schema was exported directly fom the Django model using django-extensions, pydot and GraphViz. The final data schema is shown below:

![DB Schema](media/my_project_visualized.png)

## Navigation

On the top in the middle there is a search bar that can be used to find all the products available on the website, the name of the site is on the left side and on the right side a user icon and a basket icon that shows the amount to spend for the selected products. The User Icon will display a profile option if the user is logged in if not, it will show a "login" or "register" option. The navbar has 5 categories "All products", "Towels", " Clothes", "Masks", "Artistic Designs" clicking on any of them will
take the user to the assigned category, if hyou select "All Products" a dropdown menu will appear which will give the option
to show all products available or if the user want to, show all products by price or by category.
Which ever category you select, once you see the products, above on the right you can order them by price, name or category.
In the middle of the main page there is a carousel of images with needles, threads, and embroidery equipment that makes it clear what the website is about. I used the name "Broder" which means embroidery in french. 
There is a "back to top" button at the bottom of the site for ease of navigation. 
The footer shows a little about artist description on the left in the middle the contact information, and on the right 
the social media icons if they want to follow the artists work.
The footer is visible on the entire website.

## Features Left to Implement

On one of the tabs I will like to add some pictures of the artist doing works from start to finish.
A wider descritpion of what the artist does, pictures and videos of his work on a different section.

**Bugs**

+ **Bug-01:** checkout migrations error -  It was working because the migration file was trying to remove a field named sku from one of the previous migrations, I had to delete those lines and run the migrations again,  I had to backup my database in case the migration failed with the dumpdata command.  

+ **Bug-02:** Change category error - I updated one category from the admin panel but the link on the navbar will not redirect,this was because the URL was not updated with the same name as the category, it had the old name.

Deployment
----------

To deploy this project you will need to set up accounts with the following services.

- [Github](https://github.com/)     
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)   
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)   
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)   
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)    


### Deployment to Heroku  

1. **Create a Heroku App**
    1. Create a new app by clicking the ‘New’ button.
    ![new Heroku app button](static/media/new-app.png)
    2. Give a unique name and set region to your nearest region.
    ![name and region input](static/media/name-region.png)
    3. Click ‘Create App’.
    4. Click on the 'Resources' tab, in Add-ons type: postgress and choose 'Heroku Postgres'.
    ![postgres add-on](static/media/postgress.png)  
    5. For plan name choose the free plan and click submit form.

2. **Setup the Postgres Database**
    1. In your IDE install dj_database_url and psycopg2.   
        ```
        pip3 install dj_database_url
        pip3 install psycopg2-binary
        ```
    2. Create a requirements file.  
        ```
        pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
        ```
    3. Import dj_database_url in `settings.py`.
    4. Backup the database if you're using a local database instead of fixtures.  
        ```
        python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
        ```  
        p.s. make sure you're connected to your mysql database.  
    5. Scroll down to DATABASES, comment out the default configuration and add the database url from Heroku   
        ```
        DATABASES = {
                'default': dj_database_url.parse('DATABASE_URL')
        }
        ```
        You can the database url from Heroku's Config Vars in the Settings tab. 
        > Note: The DATABASE_URL from Heroku is an environment variable and shouldn't be committed in version control.
    6. Run migrations.  
          ```
          python3 manage.py migrate
          ```
    7. In case of using a local database type:  
        ```
        python3 manage.py loaddata db.json
        ```  
        to import the data from the mySQL database to Postgre.
    8. In case of using fixtures:  
        First import the categories:  
        ```
        python3 manage.py loaddata categories
        ```  
        And then the products:  
        ```
        python3 manage.py loaddata products
        ```  
    
3. **Create a superuser**  
    - Type: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`  
    - Add a username and password.

4. **Make a distinction between local and remote database**  
    Create an if-statement in `settings.py` so that when the app is running on Heroku it connects to Postgres(remote) and otherwise, it connects to sequel light(local).  
    ```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
            }
        }
    ```
5. **Install gunicorn**  
    Gunicorn will replace the development server once the app is deployed to Heroku and will act as the web server.  
    type: `pip3 install gunicorn`

6. **Create a Heroku 'Procfile'**  
    The Procfile is what Heroku looks for to know which file runs the app and how to run it.
    1. In the terminal type: **touch Procfile** or create a new file named 'Procfile' in the root.
    2. Inside the Procfile type:   
    ```
    web: gunicorn <Github appname>.wsgi:application
    ```

7. **Connect to Heroku in the terminal**
    1. Login to your account on the Heroku website.
    2. Go to account settings (click on your avatar).
    3. Scroll down to the API Key section.
    4. Click 'Reveal' and copy your API Key.
    5. Login to Heroku via CLI  
     ```
     heroku login -i
     ```
    6. Login with your email but use the API Key as the password.
    7. Temporarily disable the collection of static files until AWS has been setup.  
        ```
        heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <Heroku appname>
        ```  
    8. Add the hostnames to allowed hosts in `settings.py`.  
        ```
        ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<heroku appname>.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']
        ```
       where 127.0.0.1 is the IP of the localhost, so that the app can also run locally.
    9. Commit to GitHub.
    10. Commit to Heroku. Make sure you have git remote initialized.  
        ```
        heroku git:remote -a <Heroku appname>
        ```  
        Push to Heroku.  
        ```
        git push heroku
        ```

8. **Setup automatic deployment from GitHub/Connect Heroku app to GitHub.**  
    1. Go to the Deploy tab.  
    ![deploy tab](static/media/deploy.png)
