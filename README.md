### User Journey

1. User's Journey starts at the homepage. 
1. They are presented with a picture hat hints at what the site it’s about.
1. In the middle they can find phrase that symbolizes art
1. On the bottom they can see and “About” description

### Design

- Colour Scheme
    - I used a friendly light emerald color scheme with a transparent option in some elements. Originally it was white but it felt a little traditional.
- Typography
    - I used 'Sarabun' as a font 
- Imagery
    - Most of the images were downloaded from pinterest with the idea of background ion white or similar 
- Wireframes
    - I created wireframes for the basic ideas. The overall structure of the website persists from the wireframes to the complete project. However, I was unable to complete certain functionality due to time contraints and had to focus on other problems.

On one of the tabs I will like to add some pictures of the artist doing works from start to finish.
